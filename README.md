# FrontLine
<b>FrontLine - SSH and SQL Database Critter</b> is written in a <b>Python Script</b>, with the support of <b>Shell Scripting</b>, capable of brute forcing a specific selected server with a bunch of passphrases and be able to load commands, access directories, data, tables from a databases, schemas and table structures and more..<br/>

<b>What is a Brute Force ?</b><br/>
In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found.

The script can access any <b>SSH Servers</b> once the correct passphrase is found during the loads of brute forcing. When the script finally accessed the SSH Server, the user can now navigate to different directories stored in the server, also can <b>create, read, update, and delete</b> different files and execute some critical commands such as <b>rm or rmdir</b> to delete files or directories, run jobs and processes saved in the server and many more. The user can also upload shell scripts that can quickly and easily manipulate files. 
This is very helpful when an attacker wants to gain some information from a specific company, or even delete their back ups and permanent files the companies is using in a daily basis.
